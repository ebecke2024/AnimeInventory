# AnimeInventory

## Project description: This is a personal passion project where I created an entire database for
an anime store consisting of Manga, Novels, Apparel, and Anime dvds. Then I used juypter notebook 
to analyze the data. I made graphs, charts, made correlations, etc. This was to see what were the best 
selling items and what everyone's favorite thing was. 

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Make sure you have all the proper programs**
  - Make sure you have Visio or another type of diagram organizing software. 
  - Install XAMPP Apache since this will be where you make the database
  - Have Juypter Notebook installed along with numpy and Pandas. 
- **Task 2 Make the blue print**
  - Create the class diagrams and relationship lines 
- **Task 3 Make the database**
  - In XAMPP Apache create the database using 5 classes: Manga, Novel, Apparel, Anime_DVD, and Inventory
  - Put the foreign keys in the inventory Class. Everything will be connected to the inventory class.
  - Execute the database so the database is made
- **Task 4 Transfer Classes to CSV files** 
  - Once you are done making the classes transfer them to CSV files
- **Task 5 analyze data in Juypter Notebook**
  - Import numpy and pandas along with the CSV files
  - Use pandas to find correlations between classes, count values, and find the mean average of sales
  - make bar graphs and charts to better see different averages, what is selling the best, and what genres 
    are the most popular.
  - Make sure to run the applications

## Project Skills Learned
  - Creating Databases with XAMPP Apache
  - Using Pandas to analyze data
  - Using Juypter Notebook to plot graphs and charts
  - Using Numpy to create arrays

## Languages Used 
  - **XAMPP Apache**: For making the database
  - **Juypter Notebook**: For Analyzing the data

## Notes
  - Makes sure you import numpy and pandas on Juypter notebook
